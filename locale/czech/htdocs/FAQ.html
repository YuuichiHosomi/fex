Meta questions:
===============

<a name="1"><a href="#1">Q</a>: Why name "F*EX" and not shortly "FEX"?

A: At publication time there was already an (older) program named "FEX" on
   freshmeat.net. 


<a name="2"><a href="#2">Q</a>: Why not use one of the commercial services like
   DropLoad, ALLPeers, YouSendIt, etc?

A: They have a limit of 2 GB or even less.
   Their security and privacy status is unknown.
   They are not open source based.
   There are no UNIX (CLI) clients for them.
   They need java, active-X, flash or other evil plugins.
   It is unknown how long they will exist - DropLoad and ALLPeers already
   have terminated their business.
 

<a name="3"><a href="#3">Q</a>: Why a camel as the logo?

A: The logo was inspired by the Perl camel, but it is based on a Steiff
   plush camel, which rides with us on our racing tandem. The logo was
   drawn by my stoker Beate

<a name="User">
User questions:
===============

<a name="12"><a href="#12">Q</a>: What is the "auth-ID"?

A: The auth-ID is an internal identification which authentificates the user.
   It will be first generated by the admin or the automatic registration
   process and can later be modified by you, the user. Think of some kind
   of a low security password.


<a name="13"><a href="#13">Q</a>: Can I use a HTTP proxy?

A: Yes.


<a name="14"><a href="#14">Q</a>: I have uploaded a HUGE file but misspelled my recipient's address. Now I
   have got an error bounce e-mail. Must I re-upload the HUGE file?

A: No, it is not necessary. You can redirect the file with 
   <a href="http://$HTTP_HOST$/rup">http://$HTTP_HOST$/rup</a>


<a name="15"><a href="#15">Q</a>: I have uploaded a HUGE file but forgot another recipient. 
   Must I re-upload the HUGE file?

A: No, it is not necessary. You can forward-copy the file with 
   <a href="http://$HTTP_HOST$/foc">http://$HTTP_HOST$/foc</a>


<a name="16"><a href="#16">Q</a>: I cannot upload files > 2 GB with my web browser!?

A: All web browsers I am aware of have bugs in their HTML-FORM
   implementation. The limit mostly is 2 GB, sometimes 4 GB. 
   
   You have to use a special F*EX client to upload files > 2 GB, see
   <a href="http://$HTTP_HOST$/tools.html">http://$HTTP_HOST$/tools.html</a>


<a name="17"><a href="#17">Q</a>: My download was aborted before it was finished. Can I resume the download?

A: F*EX supports resuming at download, but your client also has to support
   this feature. Firefox eg is missing this HTTP feature, you need an other
   client like opera, wget or fexget.


<a name="18"><a href="#18">Q</a>: My upload was aborted before it was finished. Can I resume the upload?

A: F*EX supports resuming at upload, but your client also has to support it.
   No web browser has this feature, you need a special F*EX client like
   fexsend, schwuppdiwupp or F*IX. 
   See <a href="http://$HTTP_HOST$/tools.html">http://$HTTP_HOST$/tools.html</a>


<a name="19"><a href="#19">Q</a>: My webbrowser cannot start the java client F*IX, it says:
   "found no java runtime environment, cannot start F*IX upload applet"

A: A java plugin for your webbrowser is missing. On Debian and Ubuntu you
   can install it with: "sudo aptitude install sun-java6-plugin"


<a name="20"><a href="#20">Q</a>: When I hit [ESC] in firefox the upload is canceled. Why?

A: This is a built-in feature of firefox: ESC terminates the current operation.
   Simple solution: do not hit ESC in Firefox. 
   Complex solution: ask the Firefox developers to add keyboard configuration.


<a name="21"><a href="#21">Q</a>: Sending as a F*EX user is easy, but how to receive files from others,
   outside?

A: Register them as your subusers or create a F*EX group 
   with <a href="http://$HTTP_HOST$/fuc">http://$HTTP_HOST$/fuc</a>
   

<a name="22"><a href="#22">Q</a>: Sometimes I can download a file more than once, especially when I
   repeat it quickly. Is the autodelete feature buggy?
   
A: The F*EX server has a grace time of 1 minute after first sucessfully
   download in which the file is still available. This is necessary
   because of some stupid "download managers" which requests the file
   several times at once. Otherwise they would report an error to the user.

A: Your fexmaster has set AUTODELETE=DELAY as default, which means that
   the autodelete cleanup process is called once a day.

A: Power users (use the source, Luke!) can set a "do not delete after
   download" flag.


<a name="23"><a href="#23">Q</a>: The default keep time is too short for me, I need more. How can I set it?

A: Use fexsend, ask your fexmaster or read the source code :-)


<a name="24"><a href="#24">Q</a>: I cannot download files with Internet Explorer, it tells me "Cannot
   open Internet site". What shall I do?
   
A: Use Firefox or any other Internet-compatible web browser, that Internet
   Explorer is not. This is one of the many bugs of Internet Explorer.



<a name="Admin">
Admin questions:
================

<a name="25"><a href="#25">Q</a>: I cannot install a web server like fexsrv, because I have no root
   permissions. Is there a pure-CGI-version of F*EX which runs with an
   apache web server?

A: F*EX is hard bound to fexsrv for several reasons (performance, file
   size limit, session concept, etc) and cannot be run as CGI under apache. 
   But you might have a look at
   <a href="http://gpl.univ-avignon.fr/filez/">http://gpl.univ-avignon.fr/filez/</a>
   <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/eventh/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/eventh/</a>
   <a href="http://www.schaarwaechter.de/sp/projekte/dateiaustausch.html">http://www.schaarwaechter.de/sp/projekte/dateiaustausch.html</a> (German only!)
   which implement a file exchange as pure CGIs, but with a 2 GB file size limit.


<a name="26"><a href="#26">Q</a>: F*EX is not working at all! I cannot connect to it with my web browser!

A: Check your routing, ipfilters and firewall setup. 
   Also check whether your xinetd is linked with tcp-wrapper and configure
   it correctly (hosts.allow).
   F*EX needs port 80/tcp (HTTP) and optional port 443/tcp (HTTPS).


<a name="27"><a href="#27">Q</a>: F*EX is too complicated! I need something more simplified.

A: Try <a href="http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html">http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html</a>


<a name="28"><a href="#28">Q</a>: How can I integrate F*EX in the existing user management at my site?

A: F*EX has several authentification modules: 
   local, RADIUS, LDAP, mailman and POP
   For the last 4 please contact the author <a href="mailto:framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de">framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de</a>
   

<a name="29"><a href="#29">Q</a>: I want that all of my local users can use F*EX automaticly. How?

A: Let them register theirselves with http://yourfexserver/fur
   You have to edit lib/fex.ph and set (example):
   @local_hosts = qw(127.0.0.1 10.10.100.0-10.10.255.255);
   @local_domains = qw(flupp.org ulm.sub.net);
   (Of course you have to add your real local hosts/networks!)


<a name="30"><a href="#30">Q</a>: I need more security! How can I enable HTTPS?

A: Read doc/SSL and also look for "fop_auth" in doc/concept 


<a name="31"><a href="#31">Q</a>: I need a corporate identity look. How can I configure F*EX in this way?

A: See variable @H1_extra in fex.ph and you can add HTML code to 
   htdocs/header.html

A: See htdocs/fup_template.html, modify it to your needs and use it as your
   start-page.


<a name="32"><a href="#32">Q</a>: F*EX is too complicated for my tie users. I need a simplified upload form.

A: See htdocs/fup_template.html


<a name="33"><a href="#33">Q</a>: I want the Bcc mails to fex (admin user) to be sent to another address.

A: Use procmail or write OTHERADDRESS to /home/fex/.forward


<a name="34"><a href="#34">Q</a>: Can I get a localized version in my native languange?

A: With your help, yes. Please contact the author <a href="mailto:framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de">framstag@rus.uni-stuttgart.de</a>
